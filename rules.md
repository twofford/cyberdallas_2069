# Rules

## Characters

Each player plays one or more characters (Player Characters or PCs). A character has stats, skills, cybernetics, items, weapons, and vehicles. Each character also has a speed that dictates how fast they can move. The default speed is 30. Each character also starts with five hit points. The GM runs the game world and plays all characters who are not PCs.

### Stats

There are five stats: Brawn, Charm, Intelligence, Reflexes, Tech, and Luck. The first four are integers between 0 and 10. Luck is an integer between 0 and 3 and resets every game session.

### Skills

There are 20 pre-defined skills: Athleticism, Awareness, Connections, Deception, Driving, Engineering, Explosives, Hacking, Influence, Intimidation, Investigation, Marksmanship, Martial Arts, Medicine, Melee Combat, Piloting, Seduction, Stealth, Street Smarts, and Tracking. Additionally, players can define new skills with the GM's permission. All skills are integers between 0 and 10.

### Cybernetics

Cybernetics are technological implants characters install. They can provide bonuses to stats, skills, or other, situational, benefits. Cybernetics are expensive to purchase and to maintain. Some draw a lot of power, and therefore can only be used a limited number of times before being recharged.

### Items

Items include anything useful a character posses that is not a cybernetic, weapon, or vehicle.

### Weapons

Weapons are implements of violence. Both ranged and melee weapons exist.

### Vehicles

Vehicles are locomotive devices, either piloted or un-piloted. Examples include cars, helicopters, drones, and mechs.

## Checks

When a character attempts to do something for which success is uncertain, they make a check. First, the GM declares the difficulty level of the check: easy, medium, hard, very hard, or nigh impossible. Then, the player making the check rolls a twenty-sided die (D20) and adds any relevant modifiers granted by stats, skills, cybernetics, items, etc. The result is then compared to the Degrees of Success table. On a success, the PC achieves what they set out to do. On a partial success, they achieve some of what they set out to do, or they achieve all of what they set out to do but something bad happens (a new threat emerges, a complication arises, their resources deplete, a countdown is created, or a countdown decrements). On a failure, they do not achieve what they set out to do, or they achieve some or all of what they set out to do but something very bad happens (a dire new threat emerges, a serious complication arises, their resources deplete substantially, or a countdown decrements by more than one).

### Degrees of Success Table

| Difficulty          | Failure | Partial Success | Success |
|:--------------------|:-------:|:---------------:|:-------:|
| **Easy**            | 5-      | 6–15            | 16+     |
| **Medium**          | 10-     | 11–20           | 21+     |
| **Hard**            | 15-     | 16–25           | 26+     |
| **Very Hard**       | 20-     | 21–30           | 31+     |
| **Nigh Impossible** | 25-     | 26–35           | 36+     |

## Combat

Combat occurs in rounds, divided into turns. Each character involved in a combat gets one turn per round. On their turn, a character gets three Action Points (AP). Refer to the Combat Actions Table to learn what actions can be performed in combat:

## Hacking

A character must have a cyberdeck in order to hack. Each character's cyberdeck is tailored to them; one character cannot use another character's cyberdeck without suffering a brain aneurysm. Cyberdecks are items with the following characteristics: disk space - an integer that represents the overall number of programs that can be loaded onto the cyberdeck. More advanced programs require more disk space. RAM - an integer that represents the number of programs that a cyberdeck can run concurrently. Some programs execute instantaneously, others take time to complete. A running program takes up RAM. Other bonuses: certain cyberdecks may provide bonuses to certain types of programs.
